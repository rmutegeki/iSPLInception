<h1>OPPORTUNITY Dataset for Human Activity Recognition from
    Wearable, Object, and Ambient Sensors</h1>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">We recommend to refer to this
        dataset for short as the "OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition
        Dataset" in publications.</span><br>
</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
The <span style="font-style: italic;">OPPORTUNITY Dataset for Human
      Activity Recognition from Wearable, Object, and Ambient Sensors</span>
(hereafter OPPORTUNITY dataset) is a dataset devised to benchmark
human activity recognition algorithms (classification, automatic
data segmentation, sensor fusion, feature extraction, etc).<br>
<br>
This dataset captures the challenges common to many other activity
recognition scenarios. Thus, methods proved to be robust on this
dataset can likely be successfully translated to other challenging
activity recognition problems.<br>
<br>
A subset of this dataset was used for the "<a
        href="http://opportunity-project.eu/challenge">OPPORTUNITY
    Activity Recognition Challenge</a>" organized for the <span
        style="font-style: italic;">2011 IEEE conf on Systems, Man and
      Cybernetics Workshop on "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Robust


        machine learning techniques for human activity recognition</span>"</span>.
<br>
<br>
The dataset comprises the readings of motion sensors recorded while
users executed typical daily activities in a room simulating a
studio flat. <br>
The characteristics are:<br>
<ul>
    <li>Body-worn sensors: 7 inertial measurement units (IMUs), 12 3D
        acceleration sensors, 4 3D coordinates from a localization
        system
    </li>
    <li>Object sensors: 12 objects are instrumented with wireless
        sensors measuring 3D acceleration and 2D rate of turn&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>Ambient sensors: 13 switches and 8 3D acceleration sensors in
        kitchen appliances and furniture<br>
    </li>
    <li>Recordings: 4 users, 6 runs per users. Of these, 5 are
        Activity of Daily Living (ADL) runs, where the users execute in
        a very natural manner daily activities. The 6th run is a "drill"
        run, where users execute a scripted sequence of activities. The
        ADL runs are characterized by larger variability in the way
        activities are executed, while activities in the drill run tend
        to be executed with less variability
    </li>
    <li>Annotations/classes: the activities of the user in the
        scenario are annotated on different levels. There are separate
        annotation tracks for: 4 "modes of locomotion" classes (sit,
        stand, lie, walk); a rich set of low-level action classes
        relating 13 actions to 23 objects; 17 mid-level gesture classes
        (e.g. open/close door/fridge/dishwasher, drink, toggle ...); and
        5 high-level activity classes<br>
    </li>
    <li>Data format: synchronized sensor readings and annotations in
        text matrix format (one line per sample, one column per sensor
        channel, last columns for annotations
    </li>
    <li>Data characteristics: missing data due to data loss are
        indicated by "NaN" (not-a-number) in the corresponding matrix
        entry. Data loss mostly affects wireless sensors. <br>
    </li>
    <li>Instances: all subjects and all recordings combined; modes of
        locomotion: 3653, mid-level gestures: 2551. <br>
    </li>
</ul>
The present dataset extends the dataset released for the
"OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition Challenge" in the following
manner:<br>
<ul>
    <li>It comprises the complete label set (some labels which were
        withdrawn from the files released for the challenge in order to
        evaluate the participant's submissions)
    </li>
    <li>It comprises additional label kinds: the low-level action
        classes, and the high-level activity classes<br>
    </li>
    <li>It contains additional sensors: all the object and ambient
        sensors, and additional channels from the body-worn sensors
        (e.g. quaternions from the inertial measurement units).<br>
    </li>
</ul>
Note that this dataset remains a subset of the full OPPORTUNITY
dataset described in [1].<br>
<h2>Detailed description [1]<br>
</h2>
<h3>Recording scenario</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="img/arena3.png" style=" width: 300px; height:
        248px;"><br>
    Room in which the user's activities are recorded.<br>
</div>
<br>
The activity recognition environment and scenario has been designed
to generate many activity primitives, yet in a realistic manner.
Subjects operated in a room simulating a studio flat with a
deckchair, a kitchen, doors giving access to the outside, a coffee
machine, a table and a chair.<br>
<br>
We achieved a natural execution of activities by instructing users
to follow a high-level script but leaving them free interpretation
as how to achieve the high-level goals. We furthermore encouraged
them to perform as naturally as possible with all the variations
they were used to. <br>
<br>
For each subject we recorded 6 different runs. Five of them, termed
activity of daily living (ADL), followed a given scenario as
detailed below. The remaining one, a drill run, was designed to
generate a large number of activity instances. The ADL run consists
of temporally unfolding situations. In each situation (e.g.
preparing sandwich), a large number of action primitives occur (e.g.
reach for bread, move to bread cutter, operate bread cutter). <br>
<h4>ADL run<br>
</h4>
The ADL run consists of temporally unfolding situations:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Start: lying on the deckchair, get up</li>
    <li>Groom: move in the room, check that all the objects are in the
        right places in the drawers and on shelves
    </li>
    <li>Relax: go outside and have a walk around the building</li>
    <li>Prepare cofee: prepare a coffee with milk and sugar using the
        coffee machine
    </li>
    <li>Drink coffee: take coffee sips, move around in the environment
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>Prepare sandwich: include bread, cheese and salami, using the
        bread cutter and various knifes and plates
    </li>
    <li>Eat sandwich</li>
    <li>Cleanup: put objects used to original place or dish washer,
        cleanup the table
    </li>
    <li>Break: lie on the deckchair</li>
</ol>
<h4>Drill run</h4>
The drill run consists of 20 repetitions of the following sequence
of activities:<br>
<ol>
    <li>Open then close the fridge</li>
    <li>Open then close the dishwasher</li>
    <li>Open then close 3 drawers (at different heights)</li>
    <li>Open then close door 1</li>
    <li>Open then close door 2</li>
    <li>Toggle the lights on then off</li>
    <li>Clean the table</li>
    <li>Drink while standing</li>
    <li>Drink while seated</li>
</ol>
<h3>Sensors</h3>
<h4>Body-worn sensors<br>
</h4>
The body-worn sensors include 7 inertial measurement units and 12 3D
acceleration sensors. <br>
<br>
The inertial measurement units provide readings of: 3D acceleration,
3D rate of turn, 3D magnetic field, and orientation of the sensor
with respect to a world coordinate system in quaternions. Five
sensors on the upper body are deployed using a jacket, thereby
ensuring reproducible sensor placement. The remaining two sensors
are mounted on the user's shoes.<br>
<br>
The acceleration sensors provide 3D acceleration. As these sensors
are wireless, more data loss are expected in these channels.<br>
<br>
Four tags for an ultra-wideband localization system are placed on
the left/right front/back side of the shoulder.&nbsp; These deliver
3D coordinates of the tag in a room coordinate system.<br>

<h4>Object sensors</h4>
12 objects are instrumented with wireless sensors measuring 3D
acceleration and 2D rate of turn. This allows to detect which
objects are used, and possibly also the kind of usage that is made
of them.<br>

            Most objects manipulated by the user are instrumented with a
            wireless sensor comprising a 3D accelerometer and a 2D
            gyroscope. <br>

    </tbody>

<br>
<h4>Ambient sensors</h4>
Ambient sensors include 13 switches and 8 3D acceleration sensors in
drawers, kitchen appliances and doors.<br>
<br>
The reed switches are placed in triplets on the fridge, dishwasher
and drawer 2 and drawer 3. They may be used to detect three states
of the furniture element: closed, half open, and fully open. The
drawer 1 is instrumented with a single reed switch. It fires for the
closed, half-open and fully open position, but does not allow do
distinguish the state of the drawer without additional information.<br>
<br>
The acceleration sensors may allow to assess if an element of
furniture is used, and whether it may be opened or closed.<br>
<br>

            <div>One reed switch placed on the dishwasher. When the
                dishwasher is closed the switch (up) is activated by a
                magnet placed on the dishwasher door (down), yielding a
                binary signal indicating if the door is open or closed.<br>

<h3>Annotations<br>
</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Annotations" src="img/label.png" style=" width: 600px; height:
        375px;"><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The annotations are done on five
    &#8216;tracks&#8217;. One track contains modes of locomotion (e.g. sitting,
    standing, walking). Two other tracks indicate the actions of the
    left and right hand (e.g. reach, grasp, release), and to which
    object they apply (e.g. milk, switch, door). <br>
    The fourth track indicates the high level activities (e.g. prepare
    sandwich). The high level activities relate to the situations
    indicated in the description of the ADL runs as follows (in
    parenthesis the number of the situations indicated above):
    relaxing (1, 9), early morning (2, 3), coffee time (4, 5),
    sandwich time (6, 7), cleanup (8).<br>
</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The mid-level gesture annotations is
    generated automatically from the low-level hand actions. It
    comprises coarser characterization of the user's activities. For
    instance the low-level annotations "reach door" and "open door"
    are combined into a single "open door" mid-level annotation. Here,
    the mid-level annotations comprise actions of the left and right
    hand indiscriminately. However, in practice, the users mostly
    interacted with the environment with their right hand. We
    recommend to use the mid-level annotations in first attempts to
    use this dataset.<br>

<h3>Notes about data and label quality</h3>
Recording a complex multimodal dataset implies data losses and
sensor data alignment challenges. These are issues which are common
in real-world deployment of complex multimodal sensor systems. This
dataset aims to captures these real-world issues so that one can
devise and assess robust activity recognition methods. Consequently
we limited the amount of post-processing of the data. The only
post-processing that was performed is the alignment of sensor
channels into a common matrix format (i.e. the multiple independent
devices recording data were synchronized in post-processing), and
unit conversion of the sensor data. In particular, there is no data
imputation to compensate for missing data. <br>
<h4>Body-worn sensors</h4>
Among body-worn sensors, the data from the inertial measurement
units are of highest quality. They were acquired with a wired
system, leading to little to no data loss. The placement of the
sensors is very reproducible among users and recording runs, as the
sensors were integrated within a jacket. We would recommend to first
consider this data for the high quality provided.<br>
<br>
The 3D acceleration sensors suffer from some data losses as the
sensors are wireless. This allows to study imputation techniques,
and the larger number of these sensors allows to investigate data
fusion methods to compensate for data losses.<br>
<br>
The tags providing indoor 3D localization are extremely noisy. We
recommend to use this information only after careful assessment.<br>
<h4>Object sensors</h4>
The sensors in the objects suffer from some data loss as they are
wireless. Especially the objects placed in the dishwasher in the
"cleaning" phase of the ADL runs suffer from more data losses due to
the occlusions when the dishwasher is closed.<br>
<h4>Ambient sensors</h4>
The ambient sensors suffer from little to no data loss as they were
acquired by a wired system.<br>
<h4>Annotation quality</h4>
<p>The activities were executed in a very realistic manner. This
    leads, for instance, to interleaving or merging of activities,
    which are challenging to annotate. </p>
Therefore, there may be jitter between the annotated time spans of
an activity and its true time span. We nevertheless did the best to
ensure consistency in the annotation strategy.<br>
<br>
The boundaries of high-level activities cannot be pinpointed to a
specific time due to the way users were allowed to interleave
activities (e.g. finishing to eat the sandwich while already
starting the cleanup). Rather one should assume a smoother
transition between the high level activities.<br>
The low-level action annotations are also hard to annotate due to
their extremely short duration. <br>
The mid-level gesture annotations are automatically generated from
the low-level gesture annotations. They combine multiple low-level
annotations in a single one of longer duration. For instance, "reach
door" followed by "open door" (low-level annotation) is combined
into a single "open door" mid-level annotation. These annotations
are recommended for a first assessment of methods as they are last
longer than the low-level&nbsp; actions and thus are less sensitive
to annotation jitter.<br>
The annotation of modes of locomotion is also challenging in this
environment as the way a user moves in the kitchen consists often of
very short gait sequences, sometimes consisting of even only a
single step.<br>
<h4>Other remarks and recommendations </h4>
The sensors were recorded by multiple independent systems and
aligned in post-processing. Alignment was done in the most careful
manner, however the alignment accuracy remains limited due to
technical data acquisition reasons. We recommend the users of this
dataset to keep in mind that there may be a jitter between the
channels of sensors acquired by different systems (e.g. between a
wireless sensor on body and a wired inertial measurement unit on
body). This jitter may be of the order of 100ms.<br>
<br>
Note that the segmentation of human activities is - to some extent -
a subjective process. Therefore there may be a jitter of a couple of
hundreds of milliseconds between what two observers would annotate.
The possibility of label jitter must be kept in mind in the
evaluation of activity recognition methods. <br>
<br>
We recommend first users of this dataset to consider the subset of
data used for the OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition Challenge at
first.<br>
<br>
<h3>OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition Challenge subset<br>
</h3>
The "<a href="http://opportunity-project.eu/challenge">OPPORTUNITY
    Activity Recognition Challenge</a>" organized for the <span
        style="font-style: italic;">2011 IEEE conf on Systems, Man and
      Cybernetics Workshop on "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Robust





        machine learning techniques for human activity recognition</span>"</span>
used a subset of this dataset.<br>
<br>
This subset contains only the on-body sensors without quaternion
data, and the annotations of modes of locomotion and mid-level
gestures.<br>
<br>
Specifically, the following columns were used for the challenge:
1-37, 38-46, 51-59, 64-72, 77-85, 90-98, 103-134, 244, 250.<br>
<br>
Note that some labels have been improved since the challenge, as
well as the synchronization between the sensor channels. This
results in slightly different files compared to the original
challenge, although it does not influence the baseline benchmarks in
any significant manner. <br>
The baseline performance results are provided in <span
        style="font-style: italic;">doc/ActivityRecognitionBaselines.pdf</span>
for the original challenge dataset as well as this release.<br>
<h3>How to start?</h3>
For activity recognition using on-body sensors we recommend to start
with the subset of data used for the OPPORTUNITY Activity
Recognition Challenge. We further recommend to consider at first the
data from the inertial measurement units as their quality is
highest, before considering the other modalities which may require
data imputation strategies.<br>
<h3>Baseline benchmarks<br>
</h3>
Baseline benchmarks for the OPPORTUNITY Activity Recognition
Challenge subset of the dataset are available in reference [2].
